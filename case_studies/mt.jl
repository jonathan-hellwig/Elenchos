"""
This design decouples the trigger condition from the effect of the event.

One issue I see with this design is that the ODE in the last line of the system definition is required for the whole systems to work correctly.

I feel like this approach would only work if I had strong automation on the KeYmaeraX side to generate differential invariants. This could be a research project in itself. How do I generate the correct differential invariant, cuts and ghost automatically?

# In the standard version of DifferentialEquations.jl, events are not part of the system definition and are passed as an argument to the solve function. They are allowed to directly interact with the integrator of the solve function. I think my design should be more similiar to the approach of ModelingToolkit.jl. This design is most appropriate for the cases where you are modelling hierarchical systems, where events are specific to a subsystem and not the whole system.
